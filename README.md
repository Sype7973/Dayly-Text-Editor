# Dayly-Text-Editor

## Description

- my motivation for this project was to create a text editor that would allow me to write and save notes to a cache and then be able to access them later online or offline.
- I built this project to utilise my knowledge of PWA's and webpacks as well as plugins such as workbox and indexedDB.
- This application solves the problem of not being able to access notes offline and not being able to save notes to a cache storage and indexDB.
- I learn't that webpacks and PWA's are very useful and can be used to create very useful applications, as well as how to use workbox and indexedDB to create a cache storage and database for my application.

## Installation
